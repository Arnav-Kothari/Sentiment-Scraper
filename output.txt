✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Santiago de los Caballeros. At the JFK terminal passengers have to check their own bags and bring it to the weight area: self-service at a premium price. A couple of employees for the airlines are there most of them with rude and unpolite attitude. Staff was completely unenthused about providing a good customer service. It seems that these individuals either lost the love for their jobs or were simply on auto-pilot. The aircraft look dirty and stingy with parts falling apart and dirty. The lavatory was a complete mess. I asked the staff for a bottle of water after using the lavatory and was told to return to my seat where later they gave me half a glass of water with little ice. My guess is that JetBlue cannot afford to provide drinks for their customers since this constitutes a premium service. A service of cranberry juice is a tiny 7 oz can. Simply put, pathetic! This airline does not care about providing a decent service to the Dominican Republic because they are the only choice basically. I truly wish for another way to travel to my homeland.
✅ Trip Verified |  Boston to Detroit. JetBlue is the worst airline I have experienced. I had the flight with JetBlue on 16 August. When I reached Detroit, I didn't receive of one of my Suitcases (it had 23.5 kg weights). At the airport, I filled the form to track the status of my bag. From that time unitl now, every day I call them to ask the status of my bag. They hardly answered and always promised me to call back, but no one called me back. After long time, they paid me only 650$ for delay and wanted me to fill the form related to staff inside the bag with their price and details. But, two days ago they sent me message that we only want to pay 250$ as compensation. 
Not Verified |  Our flight was delayed before we boarded, after we board and pushed off from the gate we sat on tarmac for a couple hours and pilot timed out and returned us to the gate, then the manager said they were looking for another pilot.  couple of hours passed, no news about the pilot and the whole crew left. We waited until 4.30am until we had to ask what was going on and they told us they were trying to get everyone on the next flight. Unprofessional how there was no news for hours when stranded. Then we got automatically put on the 8.30 flight when there were seats available on 5.45 flight, and we had to fight to get on the 5.45 flight once we where confirmed to be on that flight, it was taken away because they said they were reworking everything and we got put on stand-by. We were promised vouchers/points and didn’t receive a thing when we landed. First time flyers, vacation/reservations ruined, first time JetBlue customers make this right! Sat 9 hours in JFK!
Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Boston. I would not recommend scheduling a flight with Jetblue. In short, their policies allow them to cancel flights and provide no alternative without any financial responsibility if you need to book with a different airline. My wife was scheduled to fly to Boston for a wedding and her flight was cancelled with no given reason. She was automatically rescheduled for the day of the wedding, which was not useful. So she had to book a flight with a different airline, which cost an additional $200. Jetblue refused to refund us for the additional cost of the replacement flight. They later cited storms as the cause of cancellation, despite the fact that there were no storms and the alternative flight my wife took departed and landed at the same times as the flight she was supposed to take with Jetblue. They did at least refund the cost of their own flight so I'll give them a couple stars for that.
✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I fly with JetBlue in many years, unfortunately it is a total disappointment, I will keep flying with Delta I guess. Their scheduling, communication, and the attitude of the agents working on Gate D3 Atlanta airport (October 10 2019, flight 696) all are unacceptable. They changed our flight departure time twice in one hour, absolutely no communication to the travelers, the gate area is packed with travelers, they told us the flight will be delayed 2 hours, we find seats few gates away, I kept checking the screen in terminal D for updates, only Delta flights are showing, JetBlue flights displayed only on the screen next to the gate, I walked to the gate one hour before the new departure time, they told me the flight is closed, I asked for the supervisor, they replied with a nasty attitude, you have to go to the baggage claim area to speak with the supervisor (no supervisor available at the gate), they say the delay was estimate, they say all times are estimate, although the screen at the showed 2 hours delay. The only time that is not estimated is the flight close time, they failed to provide their customers with the courtesy of communication. It will be the last time I buy JetBlue tickets.
✅ Trip Verified | We were delayed 5 hours and 7 minutes flying from Orlando to DC. It was not related to weather, as very few other flights surrounding us were delayed. We were told that the plane we were supposed to be on was coming from Nassau and was delayed, so we were then put on a different plane coming from San Juan which was arriving at a later time. Scheduled departure was 12.59pm, and was changed to 6.07pm. The flight attendant announced to all of us on the plane prior to departure that we would all be entitled to and would be receiving a $150 credit. I even confirmed with her during the flight just to make sure I heard correctly. 7 days had passed and I still hadn’t received the email with instructions on where to find my credit (they told us we would be receiving one within 7 days). After being on hold multiple times, I reached out to customer service on their website and received some answers (photos attached). I was told that we would only be receiving $100 because it was weather related and that’s what the airport told them. I received many emails notifying me of the delayed (it delayed 4 times), and never was it stated that it was due to weather. Weather was not a factor that day for flying. Either in DC or Orlando, or anywhere in between. It also doesn’t state anywhere in their terms that you will not receive compensation if your delay is weather related, however this is what customer service told me. When I told her that the flight attendant told us all it would be $150, she said “I don’t know why they would say that”. JetBlue does not take responsibility for their actions, they do not stick to their terms that are clearly stated on their website. And quite frankly they aren’t helpful and are rude.
✅ Trip Verified | We took the red eye from PHX - FLL on our way to Cancun for our honeymoon. We had paid to upgrade our seats to the first row. When we boarded we stowed our single backpack about 24”x12” in the overhead. We slept most of the flight. I woke up to the flight attendant stirring through the overhead. She took down our single carryon and attempted to move it to the overhead in row 6! I stood up and told her that was my bag. She said it couldn’t be up there. I said why? She said because she needed to put her bag up there. I said why don’t you put your bag back there in row 6? She said that overhead space isn’t guaranteed. I told her I know but my bag has been up there the entire flight. She told me it hadn’t. I told it had, she told me to get back in my seat. Then came up and glared over the bulkhead at me and spoke to me with a very rude and condescending tone telling me that I was lying about where my luggage had been stowed and I should be quite and let her move it. Finally the other flight attendant got up and moved his luggage then put my luggage back where it had been the entire flight. The staff member sat in her jump seat and glared at me the rest of the flight. I contacted Jetblue and their response was overhead bin space is not guaranteed. I will never fly Jetblue again. All of our other 3 Jetblue flights also had really terrible service. One piece of our checked luggage had the front pocket torn off and contents lost. The other check bag was handled roughly enough to break plastic hangers inside it.
✅ Trip Verified |  Washington to Orlando. Very bad airway. Delay after delay with no justification, no attempt at apology, no compensation whatsoever, and not even attempt to help customers. I would never take this airline again.
New York to Sacramento. To start off I was sitting in the aisle in row 5. Then a man arrived to sit next to me in the middle seat. His arm touched my arm for most of the trip. He wasn't huge but couldn't seem to fit himself in the seat allotted him. I have personal space. Not cool. I looked forward to free movies to take my mind off my situation. It was a 5-hour trip. It wasn't working and after 3 reboots they gave up.
✅ Trip Verified | On my way to New York I asked for ear buds and was acknowledged and then ignored. I had to ask twice and a second flight attendant retrieved me some ear buds. On the way back to Palm Beach I had the same experience where I asked for tissues and was completely ignored after being acknowledged again. I’m not sure if they were so busy they both forgot. I am not difficult. I did not ask for food or drinks. Palm Beach airport was pleasant and quick. New York was slow and painful witnessing a very rude pre security ID check person. Tv shorted out as well. Very unpleasant. Before this trip I always recommended Jet Blue.
